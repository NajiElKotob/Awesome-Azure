## Basic concepts
* [Resiliency to build with confidence](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/regions/) "Azure regions, geographies, and Availability Zones form the foundation of our global infrastructure—providing customers high availability, disaster recovery, and backup."

* [What is cloud computing?](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-cloud-computing/) "Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. You typically pay only for cloud services you use, helping you lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently, and scale as your business needs change."

* [What are public, private, and hybrid clouds?](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-are-private-public-hybrid-clouds/) "There are different ways to deploy cloud resources. Options for deployment include public, private, and hybrid cloud. All three scenarios provide similar benefits, including cost-effectiveness, performance, reliability, and scale—but which deployment method you choose depends on your business needs."
