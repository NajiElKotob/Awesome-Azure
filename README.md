# Awesome Azure
Constantly growing and constantly improving

## Basic concepts

### Definitions
* **az** stands for Azure
* [Resiliency to build with confidence](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/regions/) "Azure regions, geographies, and Availability Zones form the foundation of our global infrastructure—providing customers high availability, disaster recovery, and backup."

* [What is cloud computing?](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-cloud-computing/) "Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. You typically pay only for cloud services you use, helping you lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently, and scale as your business needs change."

* [What are public, private, and hybrid clouds?](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-are-private-public-hybrid-clouds/) "There are different ways to deploy cloud resources. Options for deployment include public, private, and hybrid cloud. All three scenarios provide similar benefits, including cost-effectiveness, performance, reliability, and scale—but which deployment method you choose depends on your business needs."

* [What is Azure Compute Unit?](https://www.itprotoday.com/iaaspaas/what-azure-compute-unit) The Azure Compute Unit (ACU) is used to help understand the relative compute performance between different Azure series and size VMs. It is based on the A0 (extra small) having a value of 50. A VM with an ACU of 100 has twice the compute of a VM with an ACU of 50. A VM with an ACU of 200 would be twice that of a VM with an ACU of 100 and so on [more info](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/acu)
